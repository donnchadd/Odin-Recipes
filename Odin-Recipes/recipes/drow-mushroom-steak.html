    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicacy of the great Underdark City of Spider, <strong>Menzoberranzan</strong>, these seasoned ripplebark mushroom steaks are harvested fresh from the fungi fields near <strong>Lake Donigarten</strong>. While their exact agronomy is a closely guarded drow secret, many speculate that fertilizer from the Donigarten island rothe make these mushrooms grow unusually large, meaty, and nutrient rich.</p>
        <p>The dish has become so popular that it has migrated to the surface, and it's even rumored to be a favorite of <strong>Xanathar of Waterdeep</strong>. But make sure to carefully read the label on the bottle of balsamic vinegar, the drow are as famous for their poisons as their sauces.</p>
