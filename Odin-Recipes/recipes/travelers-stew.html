    <h1>Traveler's Stew</h1>
    <img src="travelers-stew.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nothing is more welcoming to the battered, trail-weary adventurer than the unmistakable scent of beef and ale wafting from a bubbling, flame-licked cauldron. Find a seat near the inn's blackened hearth and take a loaf off - warmth and safety are finally afoot. The only dangers here are shadows lurking in smoky wood paneled corners and the occasional barroom brawl.</p>
        <p>This earthy, slow-cooked concoction consisting of beef, carrots, potatoes, and onions in a dark beer infused broth is served in eating establishments everywhere, from the Green Dragon Inn and the Yawning Portal to Ellfate's Eatery and the Inn of the Last Home. Be warned traveler, it won't taste right without a wooden bowl and a spoon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (serves 6)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>(1/4) cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>(1 1/2) pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>(1) tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>(1) cup dark beer</li>
            <li>(4) cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>(1) teaspoon sweet paprika</li>
            <li>(1) large yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>(2) carrots, peeled andd cut into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
            <li>(3) Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>(1/4) cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of pepper. Add the beef and toss to coat well.</li>
            <li>Warm the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add one-third to half of the beef -do not crowd- and cook for about 5 minutes, turning to brown all sides evenly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the browned beef to a plate and repeat to brown the remaining beef, adding more oil, if needed, between batches.</li>
            <li>Pour the beer into the pot and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits.</li>
            <li>Return the browned beef to the pot and add the broth and paprika.</li>
            <li>Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook to a simmer until the meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, carrots, and potatoes to the pot and continue to simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
